       12. CHEER UP, Júlia! We are here to help you
       13. So, What are we going to do?
       14. We have 2 months to go. These are the things we will have to finish by the end of this week
       15. Lucas, you'll be in charge of this research here. I'll help you with that, ok?
       16. Why don't we bring some posters to put up around our neighborhood, explaining why recycling is important?
       17. EVEN THOUGH(mesmo, apesar de) we will have more work to do, it's going to be good for the project!
       18. People, I can't thank you enough. Working with a group can be hard sometimes.
       19. HOWEVER(contudo, entretanto, mesmo assim), we can have other thoughts, other views we can count on.
       20. TO PUT UP - pregar/colar
       21. My friends and I are going to develop a selective reciclyng at our neighborhood.
       22. THEREFORE(portanto, sendo assim), I thought it would be interesting for us to know how the recycling center works
       23. It is gonna be a pleasure.
       24. We have a lot of interest in projects like yours, and it is nice to know the young people, stand up for causes like recycling
       25. GONNA == GOING TO 
       26. STAND UP FOR

	besides, otherwise, on the other hand, however, even though, therefore

	planos fixos                       == GOING TO   - I am gonna buy a new house next year
	previsão/palpite                   == GOING TO   - I think I'm gonna throw up!
	previsão(certeza)                  == WILL       - I will rain(confirmado), I'm sure you'll like her
